### Introduction

Elixir is created in 2012 by Jose Valim.

Elixir uses Erlang VM which is known for low latency, distributed, fault-tolerant systems.

It is also used in web development and embedded software.

### Main Features

1. Scalable: All elixir code runs inside lightweight threads of execution that are isolated.
	they communicate each other via messages.

2. Fault-tolerant: If something goes wrong Elixir able to revert to initial state.
	That makes perfect for scalable, fault tolerant systems.

3. Function programming: Functional programming promotes a coding style that helps developers write code that is short, concise, and maintainable.
